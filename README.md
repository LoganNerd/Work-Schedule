# workschedule

In this project I was tasked with creating a work schedule using API's! I cloned the starter code and added 3 more hours to both the past and future sections. I also changed the color of future tasks to orange instead of red cause I thought the red looked a little too harsh. Unfortunately I had life happen this week and that was the most I was able to complete but nonetheless here is the link to the website and some images of the deployed application.
